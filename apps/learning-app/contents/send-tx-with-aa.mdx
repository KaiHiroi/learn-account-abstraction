## 1. Learn About UserOp

All transactions in the AA world are performed using an object called UserOperation. In
other words, knowing UserOperation is knowing AA!

UserOperation is just an object once you get going, but its creation is quite complex. So, I
have prepared a cool tool that allows you to easily experience the generation of a
UserOperation. With this tool, you can easily generate a UserOperation for a SimpleAccount
(which you should have created earlier).

Let's put aside the details and try to generate UserOperation by adding various values!

## 2. Send gas fee to AA wallet

Let's make one last preparation for sending tx. Maybe your wallet is still empty. This
means you can't even pay for gas. So let's send some money to your wallet.

## 3. Send Empty Tx with AA

Now you can finally send transactions using AA. Here are the steps for executing a
transaction in AA.

1. Prepare a contract wallet that supports AA.
2. Create a UserOp for that wallet.
3. Ask someone(bundler) to execute UserOp.

For now, just press the SendTx button without thinking. Then the AA transaction will be
executed according to the procedure. Is the transaction finished executing? You have done
it! You have executed a empty transaction by your AA contract wallet.

Let me explain what you did. You first created a UserOp to execute a transaction that does
nothing. Next, you used that UserOp to execute an EntryPoint contract. This is exactly the
same thing as the Bundler in AA. Then your AA wallet executed a transaction that did
nothing.

I want you to compare the balances in your EOA and AA wallets before and after you execute
the transaction. Surprisingly, the balance in your EOA wallet has not decreased at all (in
fact, it may have increased). Yes, the AA wallet paid for the gas for this transaction, and
the gas was returned to the EOA wallet that executed the transaction instead! This is solid
proof that you executed the AA transaction!
