## 1. Guess Address

AA wallets are just contract wallets once you go there, so you need to deploy them to the
blockchain before you use them. Before deploying,
try to guess to which address the walletwill deploy!

In this case, we will deploy a contract wallet using a contract called
[SimpleAccountFactory](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x9406Cc6185a346906296840746125a0E44976454)

In addition to deploying a contract wallet, this contract also has a function called
`getAddress` that looks up the address to which it will be deployed. The getAddress function
takes an owner (i.e., you) and a salt (any uin256 value).

<ContractCallPanel contract="simpleFactory" functionName="getAddress" />

If you look at the previous address in polygonscan, you will see that the contract has not
yet been deployed!

## 2. Deploy AA Account

Let's deploy the contract wallet. It's not that hard! In fact, creating an AA
account is not much different from deploying an ERC721 NFT. All you need to do is to execute
the deployment transaction. But the account thus created can unquestionably be used on
ERC4337!

Let's take this a step further. What are we doing now? We trying to deploy a type of
contract wallet called SimpleAccount. This is a bit of a misnomer. SimpleAccount is just one
of countless implementations (and of course you can create your own). Just as there are
countless contracts along the ERC721 standard.

In addition, this time we will use a contract called SimpleAccountFactory, which is a
contract for deploying this SimpleAccount. This is the one we call in the previous section.
The reason why we use SimpleAccountFactory is, simply put, because it is convenient. Because
it is already on-chain and can be used without any particular configuration. However, it may
be wrong to create Factory contract first when you create a new contract wallet. Because it
may lose simplicity. In fact, SimpleAccountFactory is just a contract to deploy
SimpleAccount, and it is not necessary for a small operation check.

Long story short. Now hit the Call button at the bottom (you can change the SALT, of
course).OWNER may not want to mess with it. You cannot control the wallet you have created.
Once you are sure the transaction went through, let's move on to the next section.

<ContractCallPanel contract="simpleFactory" functionName="createAccount" />

## 3. Check Address

This is the last time. Let&apos;s check the contract wallet we just deployed with
BlockchainExplorer. I would like you to paste the address you checked in Section 1 again
into PolygonScan or other software to check it. Then, the address that was treated as just
an Address earlier is recognized as a contract. This may not seem like a big deal, but it is
true that we were able to deploy an account that can be used with AccountAbstraction. This
address will be used in future courses, so make sure you save it.
